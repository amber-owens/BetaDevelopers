Madison's Beta Club

This website was created by Amber Owens and Irma Bazaldua, juniors at Madison Academic Magnet High School, for Beta Club.

Our contact information is Amber Owens: ambow2002@gmail.com Irma Bazaldua: imbzld@gmail.com

Thank you for critiquing our website. The National Beta Club was founded in 1934 by Dr. John W. Harris in Landrum, South Carolina. For more than eighty years, Beta Club has helped nearly seven million scholars learn how to make a life for themselves. Since 1991, it has awarded over $6 million in scholarships. Amber was elated to make this website.

Website Features:

Our website consists of five pages in addition to a home page. On all of our pages there are icons that link to Madison's Beta Club social medias. We have also included improvements and additions that Beta Club's original website does not include such as: current members, an online application, a donate feature, and images.

THANK YOU!
